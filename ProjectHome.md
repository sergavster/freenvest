Peer-to-peer lending sites such as Microplace, Prosper, Lending Club, MyC4 allow private persons to lend money to small businesses and persons.

Investors are faced with problems such as keeping track of their bids for loans, of their loans, of the risks associated to lending (defaults, exchange rate fluctuations when lending to other countries) and of the performance of their portfolio.

The goal of this project is to provide tools to assist investors in their decisions.
